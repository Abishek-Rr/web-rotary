= How is Emi calculated? =

An Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) is usually a fixed amount of money that you need to pay your bank or lender every month as repayment of a loan taken, until your loan is totally repaid.

The formula to calculate an EMI:

EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]

P =loan amount or Principal

R = Interest rate per month
[To calculate rate per month: if the interest rate per annum is 14%, the per month rate would be 14/(12 x 100)]

N = the number of installments
